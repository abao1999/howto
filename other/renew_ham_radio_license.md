## Renewing a HAM radio license online

Follow the instructions on [this page](https://www.fcc.gov/wireless/support/universal-licensing-system-uls-resources/renewing-license-universal-licensing)

+ Your FRN can be found by looking your call sign up in the FCC database
+ If, like me, you do not have a web account associated with your call sign, you need to contact tech support in order to set a security question, and wait for a person to respond.
+ With a security question, you can then reset your password.
+ Start a new session at the renewal webpage. When renewing, as a solo operator you are likely not eligible to check the boxes for "no fees". However, if you follow through with the application you will find that the fees are zero
