### Installing Xubuntu on my HP Stream 11

I tried this on an HP Stream 11 that was purchased in May, 2015. The PC shipped with Windows 8.1

Ubuntu's instructions suggest using Rufus on an existing Windows computer to prepare the USB stick:

Instead of Rufus:

Xubuntu distro:

[Esc] then F9 (pick boot) or F10 (set boot order)

In the F10 "Boot Settings" menu, Enable LEgacy Boot (this step is crucial). Then you can change the legacy boot order or rstart and select the boot at F9

**Note: I ended up asking a friend to use "Startup Disk Creator" on his Ubuntu system (with an Xubuntu i386 disk image) and it worked just fine. Below are some of the other things I attempted.**

Suggestions:

Start an elevated command prompt:

check the disk by running:

	chkdsk c: /f

You might have to restart windows and have it run the check when booting
