The easiest way to to use the included macro

	File > Scripts > ImageTracing

This does all of hte line tracing and canvas cropping for a collection of photos


I also wrote an Illustrator action that saves as multiple file types and changes the ARtboards to the size of the iamge, which can be found in the Actions > User Actions menu
