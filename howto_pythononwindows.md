## Using Cygwin

Download and install the full Cygwin suite

Open up the Cygwin Terminal

Go to the drive of interest. For the "C:" drive:

	$ cd /cygdrive/C

To run a program in the shell, make sure to use the "-i" flag

	$ python -i


## Using MinGW and msys

msys is a bash shell, but you have to add Anaconda to the path by creating a .bashrc or .bashprofile in the home directory (wherever the shell starts you out when if first opens). Note: there is a later version, msys2, that may have more active development

+ Install MinGW

	+ edit msys apearance by right clicking the top bar of an open shell window
