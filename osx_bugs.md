# OSX bugs

A running list of bugs and catches I've encountered with OSX Yosemite


## MATLAB looks fuzzy on a Retina computer

You need to update your Java Runtime Environment.

## Keynote can't save files or export them

Take screenshots and do whatever you can to save your work. If you try closing the file you will get the opportunity to duplicate before discard. Before you discard, try making a new document and copying all your slides into it.

All of you movie links will break for no reason. You need to manually re-import using Inspector, because right-clicking and choosing "replace" will only work for media that you've copied into Photos, which you don't use because it's 2016. If replace keeps failing, try copying your slides manually into a new document.
