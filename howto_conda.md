 ## Installing Miniconda

I generally use miniconda to avoid installing tons of packages that I don't need. It's important to download the installer for whichever python distro you want as default; you can always make an environment with a different flavor of python. As of 2020, it probably makes sense to install with the Python 3 binary, and then make environments for using Python 2. 

Currently, you can install Anaconda or Miniconda simply by downloading and running a bash script from the project website


	 $ bash ./[some long file name].sh


You can also a GUI installer for Anaconda, but I found the bash script easier to use.

## Making and using virtual environments

Now try making a new virtual environment via conda

	$ conda create -n cenv python=2.7
	(cenv) $ conda activate cenv
	(cenv) $ conda deactivate

*Note: before 2018, `source activate` and `source deactivate` were used instead of `conda activate`*

Updating conda

	 $ conda update conda


Duplicating an environment

	 $ conda list --export > exported-packages.txt
	 $ conda create -n py3clone --file exported-packages.txt

-OR-

	 $ conda create -n newname --clone oldname

Removing an environment

	 $ conda remove -n myenv --all

## Installing packages
	
	$ conda install numpy

## Distributing a package on Anaconda cloud

Create an online Anaconda cloud account [here](https://anaconda.org/)

You need to install two additional command line utilities

	conda install anaconda-client conda-build

Now login locally from the terminal, entering your username and password when prompted

	anaconda login

### Upload the package to Anaconda cloud

Disable automatic uploading and then build

	conda config --set anaconda_upload no
	conda build .

Now find out where the build was stored

	conda build . --output

This directory will be somewhere weird on your system, depending on where Miniconda is installed. Now that you know the path, run

	anaconda upload /path/to/file/somename.tar.bz2

Now you can distribute and install the package using 

	conda install -c username my_package

### Updating a package on Anaconda cloud

I have not found a more efficient way to do this besides literally deleting my package and re-uploading. There is probably a way to have versions, but it is not clearly outlined in the Anaconda Cloud documentation

### For a package that is already being distributed using PyPI

Note: this should only be done if direct uploading to Anaconda cloud isn't working---otherwise, this conflicts.
Create a tarball for the package

	python setup.py sdist

Upload the package to Anaconda Cloud

	anaconda upload dist/*.tar.gz


## Broken conda installation

Here are some fixes I've used when my conda installation stops working.

#### Revert your environment

Some packages install a mess of dependencies, which can break parts of your code. To revert, enter your environment and then view your environment's revision history

	conda list --revisions

Pick which revision you want to go back to. For revision N, run

	conda install --revision N

Found this tip [here](http://blog.rtwilson.com/conda-revisions-letting-you-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-your-environment/)

#### Attempt a partial re-installation

During an update after several months without use, conda stopped working. To recover the installation without deleting all the environments follow the guide [here](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/troubleshooting.html)

Download the same installer as your original install (mine was Python 2.7) and then run it with the -f option:

	bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -f

Make sure you install to the same location as your previous installation. You will have a chance to pick your path; I had to purposely change mine to the location of the previous install:

	/Users/william/miniconda

You may need to edit your bash settings to help get the paths correct

	emacs /Users/william/.bash_profile

#### Completely re-installing

Occasionally, I've found that conda on OSX will break with no meaningful way of recovering. These issues can be too difficult to troubleshoot on a case-by-case basis, and the easiest solution is a clean re-installation.

The question is whether it is at all possible to recover one's existing environments. I am under the impression that this is very difficult to do because of the way that internal links to moved filed are built into conda. Instead I opted for a clean re-install, which unfortunately meant that I had to re-install various packages piecemeal as I required them.

If you still have access to your old, broken conda installation, a list of what was installed can be found in a path that looks something like

	/Users/username/miniconda/envs/example_env/lib/python3.4/site-packages

You can export a list of the dependencies using

	cd ~/miniconda_broken/envs/example_env/lib/python3.4//site-packages/
	ls -d */ > ~/example_env_dependencies.txt


#### Packages install through conda, but don't show up correctly in iPython

For example, conda successfully runs

	$ conda install matplotlib

However, in a jupyter notebook (or iPython terminal), the following returns a `ModuleNotFound` exception

	$ import matplotlib

Try checking in a bare python terminal

	$ python
	>>> import matplotlib

If this works, then you don't have jupyter correctly installed in your environment, so just run

	$ conda install jupyter
